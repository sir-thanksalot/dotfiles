# .dotfiles

**WARNING**: This is meant to be used be me. Feel free to try it out or fork it, but dont complain later.. 

## TL;DR

Download and run the install script, then run the script:
```bash
wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sir-thanksalot/dotfiles/main/setitup.exclude.sh | bash
sudo .dotfiles/bootstrap.exclude.sh
```

If wget is not installed, first run:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install wget
```

## What is this?!

I tend throw away and setup new linux environments for testing/learning purposes quite often. So this scripst helps with that. 
Also my dotfiles are managed in here.
